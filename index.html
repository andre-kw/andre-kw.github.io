          There's often a bold line between beauty and function in the world of computer programming. I believe that function IS form, which makes good form paramount in creating any kind of software. I've made it my goal to bridge the two and somehow contribute to changing the current paradigm by creating beautiful software.

          My name is Andre Willie and I am a web developer based in Atlanta, GA. I've been messing with computers for almost as long as I've known how to read. But my experience with art and music from early on has turned me into a... special kind of nerd.
